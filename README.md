## Deliverable: Root Cause Analysis and Resolution for Virtual Service vs-gcp02
1. Problem Statement
The Virtual Service (VS) named vs-gcp02 was stuck in an "Initializing" state within the VMware Avi Load Balancer (NSX Advanced Load Balancer). It was reporting a recurring network configuration error, despite the Controller and Service Engines being operational.

2. Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was a fundamental network routing conflict.

The Virtual Service's IP address (VIP) and its assigned Service Engine (SE) were being placed in the same subnet (10.160.0.0/20). This is an invalid configuration because the highly specific route that Avi creates for the VIP (a /32 route) logically conflicts with the broader route for the entire subnet that the Service Engine resides in. The error message ...hides the reserved address space for network... was a direct symptom of this conflict.

3. Resolution Steps
The issue was resolved by implementing network separation, which is a best practice for this type of deployment.

Created a Dedicated VIP Subnet: A new, non-overlapping subnet (10.10.10.0/24) was created in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to be used exclusively for Virtual IPs.

Updated Avi Network Configuration: This new 10.10.10.0/24 subnet was added to the Avi Controller's configuration under Infrastructure > Networks, making it available for VIP placement.

Reconfigured the Virtual Service: The vs-gcp02 Virtual Service was reconfigured to use a new VIP (10.10.10.10) from the dedicated VIP subnet, while its backend server pool and Service Engines remained on the original server subnet (10.160.0.0/20).

This successfully isolated the front-end VIP network from the back-end server/SE network, resolving the routing conflict.
